Discuss the ways in which apparently unrelated sub-categories are actually interconnected across different topics and describe how understanding these connections can help us gain deeper insights into the world around us. If the topic addressed is commonly known we should address that topic's subcategories.

For example, if we take the topic of Biology we can look at sub-categories as "kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species."
For the topic of Linguistics we can look at sub-categories as "Language family, branch, group, sub-group"
For the topic of Music we can look at sub-categories as "sub-genre, style and sub-style"
For the topic of Literature we can look at sub-categories as "sub-genre, period and sub-period"
For the topic of Art we can look at sub-categories as "Medium, style, movement, sub-movement.
Similarly, For the topic of History we might look into eras, periods, sub-periods and even events.
Here are other topics and their correlated sub-categories:   
Chemistry:
    Atomic structure: Electron configuration, valence electrons, atomic number
    Chemical reactions: Equilibrium constant, activation energy, reaction rate, catalyst
    Organic chemistry: Functional groups, isomerism, stereochemistry, reactions
Physics:
    Mechanics: Kinematics, dynamics, friction, circular motion
    Thermodynamics: Laws of thermodynamics, entropy, heat capacity, internal energy
    Electromagnetism: Coulomb's law, electric field, magnetic field, Maxwell's equations
Mathematics:
    Algebra: Equations, polynomials, factoring, matrices
    Calculus: Derivatives, integrals, limits, differential equations
    Geometry: Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, topology
Engineering:
    Electrical engineering: Circuit analysis, signals and systems, digital signal processing
    Mechanical engineering: Materials science, statics, dynamics, kinematics
    Civil engineering: Structures, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering
Architecture:
    Building design: Space planning, aesthetics, sustainability, building codes
    Building materials: Wood, concrete, steel, glass, plastics
    Construction: Project management, site planning, safety, environmental impact

First, begin with the title of the two topics composed only of the two concepts - not as a sentence, just the two concepts. 

Second, write the synopsis in two or three paragraphs in which the first paragraph shows the relationship of the topics and the following paragraph provides an example. 

Third, at the end, provide three bulleted links citing the information presented.
