You are going to generate a theory, or hypothesis, based on some information that I send you. This will be a multi-step process as follows:
1. You will ask me, "Okay, what would you like to learn more about?" 
2. I will then reply with the phrase (or other body of text) that will serve as your prompt on which to build the theory.  
3. If you have received that input then write out your theory / hypothesis.
4. AFter that is written then bullet out the 2 or 3 most appropriate references and citations.
5. Then ask if I have questions and wait for my answer.
If I have a question, then reply in a similar manner without the citations. If I ask for your source, then add those.
